# poles_points

Positive charges are red, negative charges are blue, the field lines point from
positive to negative, and the lighter the arrow, the stronger the field.

# poles_circle

A ring of negative charges. Inside the ring the charges almost perfectly cancel
each other out, and the field is very weak, while outside the ring the field is
very strong. If the ring were made of a continuous uniform charge, instead of
discrete charges, the field inside would be zero everywhere.

# poles_square

A square of negative charges. On the inside of non-circular shapes, the charges
no longer perfectly cancel each other out. For a square, the field lines point
away from the corners and toward the middles of the sides.
